1. make sure you already installed firefox and thunderbird snap already before running de.sh and i expect you
to already install the nala package, git and also optional snap-store

2. and also if you found the flatpak "note that directories (void) is not on path" here's the fix

  ---nano ~/.bashrc
  ---add to .bashrc this
  ---export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$XDG_DATA_DIRS:/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:/home/$USER/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share
  ---source ~/.bashrc

3. /etc/gdm3/custom.conf = WaylandEnable=true

4. /etc/default/grub = GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
